British/N Airways/N said/V its/D shareholders/N accepted/V only/R 6.3/J %/N of/I the/D convertible/N capital/N bonds/N ,/, but/V that/I the/D rest/N of/I the/D issue/N will/M be/V taken/V up/R by/I underwriters/N ./.
Analysts/N said/V that/D 6.3/N %/N level/N marked/I the/D poorest/J showing/I for/I any/D major/J British/N rights/N issue/N since/V the/D 1987/J global/J stock/N market/N crash/N ./.
``/` It/P is/V close/P to/T being/V a/D record/N undersubscription/N ,/, ''/' said/V Bob/N Bucknell/N ,/, an/D analyst/N with/I London/N broker/N Smith/N New/N Court/N Securities/N ./.
``/N Fund/N managers/N do/V n't/R like/V to/T have/V rights/N issues/N that/W do/V n't/R have/V an/D obvious/J reason/N ./.

But/R except/V for/I the/D embarrassment/N ,/, British/N Air/N will/M emerge/V relatively/R unscathed/V from/I the/D flopped/N issue/N ./.

In/I late/J trading/N on/I London/N 's/P Stock/N Exchange/N yesterday/N ,/, the/D shares/N were/I off/C three/C pence/N at/I 194/N pence/N ./.
And/N because/I British/N Air/N is/I issuing/N convertible/N bonds/N rather/R than/V ordinary/I shares/N ,/, the/D share/N price/N wo/M n't/R be/V directly/W hurt/V by/I any/D surplus/N left/V with/D underwriters/N after/I they/P try/V to/T sell/V the/D issue/N in/I the/D open/J market/N ./.
But/C British/N Air/N 's/P withdrawal/N from/I the/D UAL/N buy-out/N could/M have/V further/I repercussions/N ./.
Some/C analysts/N speculated/V yesterday/R that/I the/D move/N has/V set/V off/I a/D board/N room/N split/N ,/, which/W may/M lead/V to/T the/D resignation/N of/I Sir/N Colin/N Marshall/N ,/, the/D carrier/N 's/P chief/J executive/N officer/N ./.

The/D article/N is/V ,/, unfortunately/N ,/, replete/N with/I outrageous/N distortions/N ./.
One/N of/I Mr./N Roberts/N 's/P observations/N is/V that/I the/D Bank/N 's/P own/P loan/N portfolio/N is/V in/I deep/J trouble/N because/V of/I its/D lending/N to/T developing/V countries/N ./.
This/N is/V just/R not/V so/R ./.
The/D reality/N is/I that/D Bank/N finances/N are/V rock/R solid/V ./.
As/N of/I June/N 30/N ,/, 1989/` --/: the/D day/N our/P past/J fiscal/N year/N came/V to/T a/D close/J --/: only/R 4.1/J %/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P portfolio/N was/V affected/V by/I arrears/N of/I over/C six/C months/N ./.
This/N is/I an/D enviably/J low/J level/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, the/D Bank/N follows/I a/D prudent/J provisioning/N policy/N and/I has/D set/N aside/I $/$ 800/C million/C against/C possible/J loan/N losses/N ./.
For/U the/D same/J fiscal/N year/N ,/, by/I the/D way/N ,/, the/D Bank/N 's/P net/N income/N was/I a/D robust/J $/$ 1.1/C billion/C after/I provisions/N ./.
Because/N of/I the/D business-like/N manner/N in/I which/W the/D Bank/N goes/V about/I development/N ,/, financial/J markets/N have/V confidence/N in/I it/P ./.
This/N helps/N explain/V the/D triple-A/N rating/N enjoyed/V by/I our/P bonds/N and/I our/P ability/N to/T borrow/V $/$ 9.3/C billion/C in/I fiscal/N 1989/N on/I the/D most/J advantageous/N terms/N ./.
Another/N of/I Mr./N Roberts/N 's/P criticisms/N is/I that/D Bank/N lending/N has/V done/V more/R harm/V than/I good/J ``/N by/I implanting/N the/D wrong/J incentives/N and/C deflecting/N energy/N away/R from/I economic/N development/N ./. ''/'
Here/N ,/, too/R ,/, Mr./N Roberts/N is/I way/N off/I the/D mark/N ./.
The/D reality/N is/I that/D Bank/N loans/N have/V been/V linked/V to/T policy/N improvements/N for/I 40/N years/N ./.
Our/N traditional/C project/N loans/N have/V ,/, for/I instance/N ,/, supported/V sensible/J energy/N pricing/N in/I the/D power/N sector/N ,/, sound/N interest-rate/N policies/N in/I the/D credit/N area/N and/I the/D operation/N of/I public/J utilities/N as/I efficient/J ,/, autonomous/J agencies/N ./.
By/N and/I large/J ,/, these/J efforts/N have/V borne/V fruit/N ./.
In/I my/P home/N region/N ,/, Latin/N America/N ,/, much/R of/I the/D existing/J infrastructure/N base/N --/: an/D important/J building/N block/V for/I development/N --/: has/V been/V financed/V by/I the/D World/N Bank/N ./.
Mr./N Roberts/N also/V takes/V a/D swipe/N at/I the/D Bank/N 's/P adjustment/N lending/N ./.

The/D Bank/N has/V been/V making/V adjustment/N loans/N for/I 10/N years/N ./.
As/N their/P name/N implies/V ,/, these/J operations/N are/V linked/V to/T far-reaching/C policy/N reforms/N that/I aim/N at/I helping/J borrowing/N countries/N get/V back/R on/I the/D growth/N path/N and/C at/I enhancing/N their/P credit-worthiness/N ./.
Typically/N ,/, these/J measures/N include/I reforms/N to/T downsize/V the/D role/N of/I government/N and/C parastatals/N in/I the/D economy/N ,/, to/T open/V up/R inward-looking/J economies/N to/T international/J competition/N and/C to/T promote/V the/D development/N of/I a/D vigorous/N private/C sector/N ./.
Support/N for/I the/D private/J sector/N has/V been/V a/D longstanding/J concern/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P ./.
Over/N the/D years/N ,/, it/P has/V helped/C encourage/N investments/N by/I entrepreneurs/N in/I the/D Third/N World/N through/I its/D extensive/J credit/N operations/N and/C through/I loans/N and/C investments/N by/I the/D International/N Finance/N Corp/N ./.
Most/I recently/N ,/, the/D Bank/N Group/N has/V been/V expanded/V to/T include/V the/D Multilateral/N Investment/N Guarantee/N Agency/N to/T stimulate/V direct/D foreign/J investment/N in/I developing/J countries/N by/I offering/N guarantees/N against/I noncommercial/N risk/N and/C advice/N to/T member/N countries/N on/I how/W to/T improve/V their/P business/N climate/N ./.

The/D resignations/N by/I the/D two/J executives/N ,/, considered/V hard-charging/C and/C abrasive/N by/I Reebok/N insiders/N ,/, reflect/V a/D difference/N in/I style/N with/I Paul/N Fireman/N ,/, chairman/N and/I chief/J executive/N ,/, according/V to/T several/C former/C executives/N ./.

It/P 's/V easy/P to/T get/V something/R comparable/V by/I simply/R moving/V to/T a/D higher/J altitude/N in/I the/D U.S/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, there/E are/V questions/N ,/, particularly/V among/I atmospheric/N scientists/N who/W know/V this/D subject/J best/N ,/, about/I the/D ability/N of/I anyone/N to/T know/V what/R in/I fact/P is/V happening/V to/T the/D ozone/J layer/N ./.
It/P is/V generally/R agreed/V that/W when/W CFCs/C rise/N from/I earth/N to/T stratosphere/N ,/, the/D chlorine/N in/I them/P is/V capable/V of/I interfering/N with/I the/D process/N through/I which/W ultraviolet/M rays/M split/V oxygen/N molecules/N and/C form/N ozone/N ./.
But/C ozone/J creation/N is/I a/D very/N large-scale/C natural/J process/N and/I the/D importance/N of/I human-generated/N CFCs/N in/I reducing/J it/P is/V largely/I a/D matter/N of/I conjecture/N ./.
The/D ozone/J layer/N is/I constantly/N in/I motion/N and/C thus/W very/V hard/R to/T measure/V ./.
What/W scientists/M have/V known/V since/V the/D late/J 1970s/N is/I that/W there/E is/I a/D hole/N in/I the/D layer/N over/I Antarctica/N that/W expands/V or/V contracts/N from/I year/N to/T year/N ./.
But/U it/P is/V at/I least/J worthy/N of/I some/J note/N that/W there/E are/V very/R few/J refrigerators/N in/I Antarctica/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, surely/V someone/W has/V noticed/V that/D household/J refrigerators/N are/V closed/V systems/N ,/, running/V for/I many/J years/N without/V either/V the/D CFC/N gas/N or/V the/D insulation/N ever/R escaping/V ./.
Another/N argument/N of/I the/D environmentalists/N is/I that/W if/V substitutes/V are/V available/N ,/, why/R not/R use/V them/P ?/.
Mr./N Teagan/N cites/I a/D list/N of/I substitutes/N but/V none/R ,/, so/V far/R ,/, match/V the/D nonflammable/N ,/, nontoxic/N CFCs/N ./.
Butane/N and/C propane/N can/M be/V used/V as/I coolants/N ,/, for/I example/N ,/, but/R are/V flammable/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, new/I lubricants/N will/M be/V needed/V to/T protect/V compressors/N from/I the/D new/J formulations/N ,/, which/W ,/, as/V with/D CFCs/N ,/, are/V solvents/N ./.
Mr./N Teagan/N points/N out/R as/V well/R that/W if/V the/D equipment/N designed/V to/T get/V along/R without/I CFCs/N is/V less/R efficient/J than/I current/J devices/N ,/, energy/N consumption/N will/M rise/V and/I that/W will/M worsen/V the/D greenhouse/N effect/N ./.
Folks/N in/I the/D Midwest/N who/W just/R suffered/V a/D mid-October/N snowstorm/N may/M wonder/V where/I the/D greenhouse/N was/I when/W they/P needed/V it/R ,/, but/R let/V 's/P not/V be/V flippant/N about/I grave/N risks/N ./.
As/N it/P happens/V ,/, Arthur/C D./N Little/N is/V not/R at/I all/J interested/N in/I throwing/V cold/J water/N on/I ozone/J depletion/N and/I global/J warming/N theories/N ./.

There/E is/V ,/, after/I all/C ,/, big/J money/N in/I environmentalism/N ./.
Maybe/N we/P should/M ask/V why/R it/P was/V that/D Du/N Pont/N so/V quickly/P capitulated/N and/C issued/I a/D statement/N ,/, giving/I it/P wide/J publicity/N ,/, that/W it/P was/V withdrawing/J CFCs/N ./.

One/N answer/N is/I that/D big/J companies/N are/V growing/J weary/N of/I fighting/J environmental/J movements/N and/C are/V trying/P instead/V to/T cash/N in/I on/I them/P ,/, although/V they/P never/P care/N to/T put/V it/P quite/V that/D way/N ./.

University/N professors/N and/C consultants/N with/I scientific/J credentials/N saw/V a/D huge/J market/N for/I their/D services/N evaporate/N when/I price/N decontrol/N destroyed/V the/D energy/N crisis/N and/C thus/I the/D demand/N for/I ``/C alternative/J energy/N ./. ''/'
They/N needed/V new/I crises/N to/T generate/V new/I grants/N and/C contracts/N ./.
In/I other/J words/N ,/, environmentalism/N has/V created/V a/D whole/J set/N of/I vested/J interests/N that/W fare/V better/R when/W there/E are/V many/I problems/N than/I when/W there/E are/V few/R ./.
That/W tends/V to/T tilt/V the/D public/J debate/N toward/I ``/N solutions/N ''/' even/V when/R some/V of/I the/D most/J knowledgeable/J scientists/N are/V skeptical/N about/I the/D seriousness/N of/I the/D threats/N and/I the/D insistence/N of/I urgency/N ./.

Playing/` black/D in/I the/D first/J game/N ,/, the/D human/J champion/N maneuvered/N Deep/N Thought/N ,/, known/V for/I its/D attacking/J prowess/N ,/, into/I a/D totally/N passive/N position/N ./.

Though/N almost/V everybody/R at/I the/D playing/J site/N had/V been/V looking/V for/I the/D 26-year-old/N Soviet/N to/T beat/V the/D Pennsylvania-based/N computer/N ,/, he/P gave/V the/D machine/N a/D far/R worse/J drubbing/N than/I many/J expected/N ./.
And/N when/I Mr./N Kasparov/N strode/N into/I the/D playing/J hall/N ,/, he/P called/V the/D outcome/N ./.
As/N if/V he/P were/V Iron/N Mike/N ,/, about/C to/T enter/V the/D ring/N with/I a/D 98-pound/N weakling/N ,/, he/P declared/V :/: ``/` I/P 'll/M be/V able/V to/T beat/V any/D computer/N for/I the/D next/J five/C years/N ./. ''/'
His/P strategy/N against/I D.T./N was/V based/V on/I a/D thorough/J study/N of/I dozens/C of/I its/D games/N ,/, he/P said/V ,/, including/C its/D notorious/J whippings/N of/I the/D grandmasters/N Bent/N Larsen/N of/I Denmark/N and/C Robert/N Byrne/N of/I the/D U.S./N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/I underwhelmed/N ./.
``/` The/D computer/N 's/P mind/N is/V too/R straight/R ,/, too/V primitive/R ,/, ''/' lacking/V the/D intuition/N and/C creativity/N needed/V to/T reach/V the/D top/N ,/, he/P said/V ./.
The/D champion/N apparently/V was/V not/R worried/V at/I all/C about/C D.T./N 's/P strong/J points/N ./.
Its/R chief/J builder/N ,/, Taiwan-born/C Feng-hsiung/N Hsu/N ,/, nicknamed/V his/P brainchild/N ``/C the/D Weasel/N ''/' for/I its/D tactical/J flair/N at/I wriggling/N out/I of/D horrible/J positions/N ./.
D.T./` also/R has/V a/D prodigious/N and/C flawless/N memory/N ,/, is/D utterly/J fearless/N ,/, and/C could/M n't/R be/V distracted/V by/I the/D sexy/J nude/N sculptures/N spread/V around/I the/D playing/J hall/N ,/, in/I the/D New/N York/N Academy/N of/I Art/N ./.
In/I fact/N ,/, D.T./N never/P left/V home/N ,/, Carnegie/C Mellon/N University/N in/I Pittsburgh/N ,/, but/R communicated/V with/I its/D human/J handlers/N by/I telephone/N link/N ./.
They/N conceded/V that/I the/D odds/N favored/V Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, but/V they/P put/V their/P hope/N in/I D.T./N 's/P recently/V enhanced/J capacity/N for/I examining/J positions/N --/: up/R to/T a/D million/C per/C second/N ,/, from/I 720,000/N ./.
But/U the/D handlers/N mistakenly/V stuck/V with/D silicon/N chips/N ;/: they/P needed/J kryptonite/N ./.
This/N became/V apparent/I as/D game/N one/C ,/, a/D Sicilian/N Defense/N by/I Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, proceeded/V ./.
No/U human/J can/M examine/V millions/C of/I moves/N ,/, but/V Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, using/V his/P ineffably/V powerful/J brain/N ,/, consistently/V found/V very/R good/J ones/N ./.
After/N eight/C moves/N by/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D board/N was/I the/D same/J as/N in/I a/D game/N in/I which/D Nigel/N Short/N of/I Great/N Britain/N fought/V the/D champion/N to/T a/D draw/N in/I 1980/N ./.
But/U the/D computer/N did/M n't/R play/J Mr./N Short/N 's/P ninth/V move/V ,/, a/D key/J pawn/N thrust/N ,/, and/I its/D position/N deteriorated/V rapidly/R ./.
Instead/N of/I castling/N ,/, a/D standard/N measure/V to/T safeguard/V the/D king/N ,/, D.T./N made/V a/D second-rate/N rook/N maneuver/N at/I move/N 13/N ;/: then/V it/P put/V a/D knight/J offside/N on/I move/N 16/N ./.
``/N Only/N two/C classes/N of/I minds/N would/M think/V of/I this/D --/: very/R weak/J human/J players/N ,/, and/C computers/N ,/, ''/' said/V Edmar/N Mednis/N ,/, the/D expert/J commentator/N for/I the/D match/N ,/, which/W was/V attended/V by/I hundreds/C of/I chess/C fans/N ./.
By/N move/V 21/N ,/, D.T./N had/V fallen/V into/I a/D deep/J positional/N trap/N ./.
It/P allowed/V Mr./N Kasparov/N to/T exchange/V his/P dark-squared/N bishop/N for/I one/C of/I D.T./N 's/P knights/N ./.
Bishops/` usually/R are/V worth/V slightly/R more/R than/I knights/D ,/, but/V in/I this/D case/N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/V left/V with/I a/D very/R dangerous/J knight/N and/C D.T./N 's/P surviving/J bishop/N was/V reduced/V to/T passivity/N ./.
Indeed/N ,/, it/P looked/V more/R like/V a/D pawn/N ,/, a/D ``/N tall/C pawn/N ,/, ''/' as/I spectators/N snidely/N put/V it/P ./.
Consistently/N ,/, D.T./N was/I over-optimistic/N about/I its/D chances/N ,/, which/W it/P continually/V sized/V up/R ,/, in/I numerical/J form/N ./.
When/N most/I spectators/N thought/V its/D position/N hopeless/N ,/, the/D computer/N thought/V it/P was/V only/R ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, one-half/N of/I a/D pawn/N down/R ./.
Such/N evaluations/N met/V with/D derision/N ,/, and/C kept/V the/D machine/N from/I resigning/N as/V soon/R as/V humans/N would/M have/V --/: prompting/F more/J derision/N ./.
While/N D.T./N shuffled/V its/D king/N back/R and/J forth/N in/I a/D defensive/J crouch/N ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N maneuvered/V the/D knight/N to/T a/D dominant/J outpost/N ./.
He/P also/V launched/V a/D kingside/N storm/N ,/, sacrificing/V a/D pawn/N to/T denude/C D.T./N 's/P king/N ./.
No/U amount/N of/I weasling/N could/M have/V saved/V this/D game/N for/I D.T./`
A/D piece/N down/R ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/N ./.
Now/N ,/, with/I the/D crowd/N in/I the/D analysis/N room/N smelling/N figurative/N blood/N ,/, the/D only/J question/N seemed/V to/T be/V how/R fast/J Mr./N Kasparov/N could/M win/V game/N two/C ./.
With/I the/D advantage/N of/I playing/J white/J -LRB-/N which/W moves/V first/D -RRB-/N ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N followed/V up/R cleverly/V against/I the/D computer/N 's/P defense/N ,/, a/D Queen/N 's/P Gambit/N Accepted/N ./.
As/N early/I as/D move/N six/C ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N deviated/N from/I a/D well-known/N sequence/N of/I moves/N ,/, developing/V a/D knight/N instead/V of/I making/V a/D standard/J bishop/N attack/N against/I the/D computer/N 's/P advanced/J knight/N ./.
This/N left/V the/D computer/N with/I a/D broader/J range/N of/I plausible/J replies/N --/: and/C it/P immediately/N blundered/N by/I moving/V a/D queenside/N pawn/N ,/, to/T the/D neglect/N of/I kingside/N development/N ./.
``/N In/I a/D new/J position/N just/V after/I the/D opening/N ,/, a/D computer/N will/M have/V serious/J problems/N ,/, ''/' Mr./N Kasparov/N said/V later/R ./.
In/I such/J positions/N ,/, he/P explained/V ,/, ``/` you/U have/V to/T create/V something/R new/I ,/, and/I the/D computer/N is/V n't/R able/V to/T do/V that/I right/P now/V ./. ''/'
After/N only/I 11/N moves/N for/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D computer/N 's/P position/N was/I shaky/N ./.
Greedily/N ,/, it/P grabbed/V a/D pawn/N ,/, at/I the/D cost/N of/I facing/V a/D brutal/J attack/N ./.
And/N when/I a/D defensive/N move/V was/V called/V for/I ,/, D.T./N passed/V up/R an/D obvious/J pawn/N move/V and/V instead/R exposed/V its/D queen/N to/T immediate/V tactical/J threats/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N remarked/V later/I that/D ``/N even/V a/D weak/J club/N player/N ''/' would/M have/V avoided/V the/D queen/J move/N ./.
Now/N ,/, after/I only/V a/D dozen/J moves/N ,/, spectators/N were/I looking/N for/I a/D mating/J combination/N ./.
On/U a/D demonstration/N board/N ,/, emcee/N Shelby/N Lyman/N showed/I a/D quick/J kill/N initiated/V by/I a/D knight/J sacrifice/N ;/: no/J spectator/N refuted/V this/D line/N of/I play/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N 's/P continuation/N was/V slower/R but/R ,/, in/I the/D end/N ,/, just/R as/V deadly/N ./.
He/P won/V D.T./N 's/P queen/N for/I two/C minor/J pieces/N and/C two/C pawns/C --/: not/R enough/V compensation/N ,/, in/I this/D position/N ,/, to/T give/V the/D computer/N much/R hope/U ./.
In/I a/D hopeless/J position/N ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/V rather/R than/V make/V its/D 37th/N move/V ./.
And/N Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, to/T cheers/V and/I applause/N ,/, marched/V back/R into/I the/D analysis/N room/N ./.
``/N In/I both/J games/N I/P got/V exactly/R what/W I/P wanted/V ,/, ''/' he/P said/V ./.

Just/N ask/V Richard/N Blumenfeld/N ,/, a/D New/N Jersey/N dentist/N who/W considers/V himself/P ``/V a/D reasonably/J sophisticated/J investor/N ./. ''/'
In/I May/N 1986/N ,/, Dr./N Blumenfeld/N gave/I Merrill/N Lynch/N &/N Co./N about/I $/$ 40,000/C for/I a/D federally/N insured/N certificate/N of/I deposit/N offering/V an/D effective/J yield/N of/I more/R than/I 9/N %/N ./.
``/` It/P was/V a/D time/N when/I interest/N rates/N came/V down/R very/V rapidly/R ,/, ''/' Dr./N Blumenfeld/N recalls/N ./.
Yields/N on/I five-year/N CDs/N at/I major/J banks/N were/I averaging/N about/I 7.45/N %/N ,/, and/C 10-year/N Treasury/N notes/N were/V paying/V less/R than/I 8/N %/N ./.
The/D CD/N seemed/V like/V a/D great/J deal/N ./.
But/C nearly/C 3/N years/V later/R ,/, Merrill/N says/V the/D investment/N is/V worth/V about/I $/$ 43,000/C --/: an/D amount/N that/W represents/V an/D annual/N return/V of/I just/R over/I 2/N %/N on/I Dr./N Blumenfeld/N 's/P $/$ 40,000/C ./.
The/D problem/N is/V that/I the/D CD/N he/P bought/V for/I a/D retirement/N plan/N was/V n't/R a/D plain/N vanilla/N CD/N ./.
Instead/N ,/, his/P Merrill/N broker/N put/V him/P in/I a/D zero-coupon/N CD/N ,/, which/W is/V sold/V at/I a/D deep/J discount/N to/T its/D face/N value/N ./.
The/D difference/N between/I the/D price/N and/I the/D face/N value/N payable/N at/I maturity/N is/I the/D investor/N 's/P return/V ./.
More/N important/J ,/, the/D CD/N was/V purchased/V on/I the/D secondary/N ,/, or/V resale/N ,/, market/N ./.
Because/U the/D CD/N had/I an/D effective/J yield/N of/I 13.4/N %/N when/I it/P was/V issued/V in/I 1984/N ,/, and/C interest/N rates/N in/I general/N had/V declined/J sharply/N since/V then/R ,/, part/N of/I the/D price/N Dr./N Blumenfeld/N paid/V was/I a/D premium/N --/: an/D additional/J amount/N on/I top/N of/I the/D CD/N 's/P base/N value/N plus/N accrued/N interest/N that/W represented/V the/D CD/N 's/P increased/J market/N value/N ./.
Now/U the/D thrift/N that/W issued/V the/D CD/N is/I insolvent/N ,/, and/C Dr./N Blumenfeld/N has/V learned/V to/T his/P surprise/V that/I the/D premium/N is/V n't/R insured/V under/I federal/J deposit/N insurance/N ./.
The/D tip-off/N came/V when/I he/P opened/V a/D recent/J Merrill/N Lynch/N statement/N and/C found/V that/I the/D CD/N 's/P ``/N estimated/V current/J market/N value/N ''/' had/V plummeted/V by/I $/$ 9,000/C in/I a/D month/N ./.
Several/N phone/N calls/V and/I a/D visit/N to/T his/P broker/N 's/P office/N later/I ,/, the/D dentist/N found/V out/R that/I the/D $/$ 9,000/C drop/V represented/V the/D current/J value/N of/I the/D premium/N he/P paid/V when/I he/P bought/V the/D CD/N ,/, and/C that/I the/D amount/N was/I n't/P insured/N ./.

The/D quarter/N net/N was/I below/J analyst/N expectations/N mainly/R because/V truck-parts/N sales/N did/M n't/R rebound/V in/I September/N from/I the/D summer/J doldrums/N as/I they/P usually/V do/V ,/, said/V Patrick/N E./N Sheridan/N ,/, analyst/N with/I McDonald/N &/N Co/N ./.

In/I Poland/N 's/P rapid/J shift/N from/I socialism/N to/T an/D undefined/N alternative/N ,/, environmental/J issues/N have/V become/V a/D cutting/J edge/N of/I broader/D movements/N to/T restructure/V the/D economy/N ,/, cut/V cumbersome/J bureaucracies/N ,/, and/C democratize/N local/J politics/N ./.
Initial/N steps/N were/V taken/V at/I Poland/N 's/P first/D international/J environmental/J conference/N ,/, which/W I/P attended/V last/J month/N ./.
The/D conference/N ,/, held/V in/I Lower/N Silesia/N ,/, was/D co-sponsored/N by/I the/D Environment/N Ministry/N ,/, the/D Rockefeller/N Brothers/N Fund/N ,/, and/I the/D Polish/N Ecological/N Club/N ,/, and/I was/D attended/N by/I 50/N Poles/N from/I government/N and/C industry/N ,/, as/V well/R as/V Hungarians/N ,/, Czechs/N ,/, Russians/N ,/, Japanese/N and/C Americans/N ./.
The/D conference/N was/V entitled/I ``/N Economic/N Mechanisms/N for/I Environmental/N Protection/N ,/, ''/' a/D significant/J departure/N from/I East/N Bloc/N usage/N ,/, which/W recognizes/V only/R one/C economic/N mechanism/N --/: central/J planning/N --/: to/T direct/V industrial/J behavior/N ./.
Even/N more/R remarkably/V ,/, it/P focused/V on/I emissions/N trading/N and/I similar/J market/N approaches/N to/T address/N pollution/N ,/, notwithstanding/N Poland/N 's/P lack/V of/I functioning/N markets/N ./.
Why/C did/C East/N Bloc/N participants/N unanimously/N endorse/N market-based/N pollution/N approaches/N ?/.
The/D answer/N lies/V both/R in/I the/D degraded/J environment/N of/I these/J countries/N and/I the/D perceived/J causes/N of/I that/D degradation/N ./.
Like/N other/I East/N Bloc/N countries/N ,/, Poland/N possesses/V environmental/J laws/N more/R honored/V in/I their/P breach/V than/R in/I their/D observance/N ./.
According/N to/T a/D detailed/J report/N by/I Zbigniew/N Bochniarz/N of/I the/D University/N of/I Minnesota/N 's/P Hubert/N Humphrey/N Institute/N ,/, 27/C areas/N containing/I a/D third/N of/I Poland/N 's/P population/N are/V regarded/V as/I ``/N ecological/N hazards/N ''/' due/V to/T multiple/J violations/N of/I standards/N ./.
Norms/N are/V consistently/V exceeded/V at/I 60/N %/N of/I nitrogen/N oxide/N monitoring/N sites/N and/C 80/N %/N of/I those/N for/I dust/N and/C soot/N emissions/N ./.
Four-fifths/N of/I Poland/N 's/P soils/N have/V become/V highly/I acidified/N ;/: 70/C %/N of/I its/D southern/J forests/N are/V projected/V to/T die/V by/I century/N 's/P end/N ./.
Between/N 1965/N and/C 1985/N ,/, Polish/C waters/N fit/V for/I human/J consumption/N dropped/V from/I 33/N %/N to/T 6/C %/N of/I all/J surface/N waters/N ,/, while/V those/R unfit/V even/R for/I industry/N use/V nearly/R doubled/V ./.
Poland/N produces/V about/I 20/N times/V more/J soot/N and/C five/C times/N more/I sulfur/N dioxide/N and/I solid/J waste/N per/C unit/N of/I gross/C national/J product/N than/I does/J Western/N Europe/N ./.
Its/N mortality/N rate/N for/I males/N over/I 35/N is/V about/I 50/N %/N higher/V than/I West/N Germany/N 's/P ,/, and/C 50/N %/N higher/V in/I hazard/N areas/N than/I the/D national/J average/N ./.
Since/I 1978/N ,/, average/N annual/I growth/N rates/N for/I most/J pollutants/N have/V outstripped/V the/D growth/N of/I GNP/N ./.
Conference/N participants/N saw/V these/J effects/N as/I flowing/N directly/N from/I -LRB-/C a/D -RRB-/N Marxist/N devaluation/N of/I environmental/J resources/N ,/, which/W are/V not/R produced/V by/I labor/J ;/: -LRB-/C b/C -RRB-/N planned/V economies/N '/P inability/N to/T control/N pollution/N where/I enterprises/N are/V state-owned/C and/C penalties/N are/V paid/V by/I the/D government/N ;/: and/C -LRB-/N c/N -RRB-/C the/D continuing/J Stalinist/N emphasis/N on/I heavy/J industry/N for/I economic/N development/N ,/, producing/V a/D far/R heavier/R and/V more/R wasteful/V use/V of/I energy/N and/I natural/J resources/N than/V in/I the/D West/N ./.
They/N repeatedly/V noted/V that/D environmental/J progress/N could/M not/V be/R secured/V without/I true/J ownership/N ,/, genuine/J competition/N based/V on/I market/N factors/N ,/, and/I the/D risk/N of/I bankruptcy/N if/V a/D business/N makes/V the/D wrong/J decisions/N ./.
The/D solutions/N they/P formally/N proposed/V included/J taxes/N ,/, conservation/J and/J recycling/N incentives/N ,/, reforestation/N offsets/N ,/, transferable/J pollution/N permits/N ,/, an/D ecological/J bank/N to/T finance/N pollution-reduction/N credits/N ,/, and/C debt-for-environment/N swaps/N ./.
But/U their/P most/V fundamental/J recommendation/N was/V to/T separate/J industry/N from/I the/D state/N ,/, making/V it/P fully/V accountable/V for/I pollution/N control/N ./.
A/D revolution/N takes/V more/R than/I conference/N manifestos/N ./.
Indeed/N ,/, skepticism/N was/I amply/N captured/N by/I a/D joke/N told/V by/I Poles/N at/I the/D conference/N :/: ``/` The/D world/N must/M be/V coming/V to/T an/D end/N ./.

And/U the/D Poles/N are/V engaged/V in/I commerce/N ./. ''/'
But/U the/D implications/N of/I such/V a/D shift/N to/T market/N approaches/N go/V well/R beyond/I the/D fact/N that/I Poland/N is/V already/R working/V on/I nationwide/J emissions/N trades/N to/T reduce/V smelter/N pollution/N ,/, or/V that/I the/D Soviets/N plan/N to/T introduce/V marketable/J pollution/N permits/V in/I some/J republics/N next/N year/N ./.

Faced/N with/I a/D $/$ 40/C billion/C foreign/C debt/N and/C skyrocketing/N inflation/N ,/, Poland/N must/I privatize/N industry/N and/I eliminate/J subsidies/N to/T stabilize/V its/D currency/N and/C qualify/N for/I international/J assistance/N ./.
Market-based/N pollution/N control/N may/M consume/V some/I capital/N that/W would/M otherwise/V purchase/N state/N industries/N ./.

--/: Least-cost/C solutions/N ./.
As/N conferees/N noted/V ,/, scarce/C capital/N means/V the/D costs/N of/I control/N must/M be/V minimized/N through/I a/D broad/J menu/N of/I compliance/N choices/N for/I individual/J firms/N ./.
That/W means/V simple/J ,/, clear/J rules/N that/W secure/V the/I first/D large/J blocks/N of/I reduction/N ,/, deferring/V more/R complex/J issues/N such/I as/D risk/N ./.

That/W 's/P because/V quota-trained/N managers/N will/M likely/M respond/V better/R to/T quantity/V than/V to/T price/N signals/N ./.
--/: Creative/C financing/N ./.

Why/C ca/M n't/R we/P teach/V our/P children/N to/T read/V ,/, write/V and/I reckon/N ?/.
It/P 's/P not/V that/I we/P do/V n't/R know/V how/R to/T ,/, because/V we/P do/V ./.
It/P 's/P that/W we/P do/V n't/R want/V to/T ./.
And/U the/D reason/N we/P do/V n't/R want/V to/T is/V that/D effective/J education/N would/M require/V us/N to/T relinquish/V some/I cherished/J metaphysical/N beliefs/N about/I human/J nature/N in/I general/J and/I the/D human/J nature/N of/I young/J people/N in/I particular/J ,/, as/V well/R as/V to/T violate/V some/I cherished/N vested/V interests/N ./.
These/N beliefs/N so/V dominate/V our/P educational/J establishment/N ,/, our/P media/N ,/, our/P politicians/N ,/, and/C even/V our/P parents/N that/I it/P seems/V almost/R blasphemous/V to/T challenge/V them/P ./.
Here/N is/I an/D example/N ./.
If/U I/P were/V to/T ask/V a/D sample/N of/I American/N parents/N ,/, ``/C Do/C you/U wish/U the/D elementary/J schools/N to/T encourage/V creativity/N in/I your/J children/N ?/. ''/' the/D near-unanimous/N answer/N would/M be/V ,/, ``/` Yes/U ,/, of/I course/N ./. ''/'
But/U what/W do/V we/P mean/V ,/, specifically/R ,/, by/I ``/N creativity/N ''/' ?/.
No/U one/C can/M say/V ./.
In/I practice/N ,/, it/P ends/V up/R being/V equated/V with/I a/D ``/N self-expression/N ''/' that/W encourages/V the/D youngsters/N '/P ``/N self-esteem/N ./. ''/'
The/D result/N is/I a/D generation/N of/I young/J people/N whose/I ignorance/N and/I intellectual/J incompetence/N is/V matched/V only/R by/I their/D good/J opinion/N of/I themselves/P ./.
The/D whole/J notion/N of/I ``/N creativity/N ''/' in/I education/N was/I -LRB-/N and/I is/D -RRB-/N part/I and/C parcel/N of/I a/D romantic/J rebellion/N against/I disciplined/J instruction/N ,/, which/W was/D -LRB-/N and/I is/D -RRB-/N regarded/V as/I ``/N authoritarian/N ,/, ''/' a/D repression/N and/C frustration/N of/I the/D latent/N talents/N and/I the/D wonderful/N ,/, if/R as/V yet/R undefined/V ,/, potentialities/C inherent/N in/I the/D souls/N of/I all/C our/P children/N ./.
It/P is/V not/R surprising/I that/D parents/N find/V this/D romantic/J extravagance/N so/V attractive/J ./.
Fortunately/N ,/, these/J same/J parents/N do/V want/V their/P children/N to/T get/V a/D decent/J education/N as/V traditionally/R understood/V ,/, and/C they/P have/V enough/V common/J sense/N to/T know/V what/W that/D demands/N ./.
Their/N commitment/N to/T ``/- creativity/S ''/' can/M not/R survive/V adolescent/J illiteracy/N ./.
American/N education/N 's/P future/N will/M be/V determined/V by/I the/D degree/N to/T which/W we/P --/: all/R of/I us/N --/: allow/V this/D common/J sense/N to/T prevail/V over/I the/D illusions/N that/I we/P also/J share/N ./.
The/D education/N establishment/N will/M fight/V against/I common/J sense/N every/I inch/N of/I the/D way/N ./.
The/D reasons/N are/V complex/J ,/, but/V one/C simple/J reason/N ought/V not/R to/T be/V underestimated/N ./.
``/N Progressive/N education/N ''/' -LRB-/N as/I it/P was/V once/R called/V -RRB-/N is/V far/R more/R interesting/J and/J agreeable/N to/T teachers/V than/I is/D disciplined/J instruction/N ./.
It/P is/V nice/R for/I teachers/N to/T think/V they/P are/V engaged/V in/I ``/N personality/N development/N ''/' and/C even/V nicer/N to/T minimize/V those/J irksome/N tests/N with/I often/D disappointing/J results/N ./.
It/P also/V provides/J teachers/N with/I a/D superior/J self-definition/N as/I a/D ``/N profession/N ,/, ''/' since/V they/P will/M have/V passed/V courses/N in/I educational/J psychology/N and/I educational/J philosophy/N ./.
I/U myself/U took/V such/J courses/N in/I college/N ,/, thinking/N I/P might/M end/V up/R a/D schoolteacher/N ./.
They/U could/M all/V fairly/V be/R described/V as/I ``/N pap/N ''/' courses/N ./.
But/U it/P is/V unfair/V to/T dump/V on/I teachers/N ,/, as/D distinct/J from/I the/D educational/J establishment/N ./.
I/P know/V many/I schoolteachers/N and/C ,/, on/I the/D whole/N ,/, they/P are/V seriously/R committed/V to/T conscientious/V teaching/N ./.
They/U may/M not/R be/V among/I the/D ``/N best/N and/C brightest/N ''/' of/I their/D generation/N --/: there/E are/R very/V few/R such/J people/N ,/, by/I definition/N ./.
But/U they/P need/V not/R be/V to/T do/V their/P jobs/N well/V ./.
Yes/U ,/, we/P all/V can/M remember/V one/C or/C two/C truly/N inspiring/N teachers/N from/I our/P school/N days/N ./.
But/U our/P education/N proceeded/V at/I the/D hands/N of/I those/J others/N ,/, who/W were/V merely/I competent/J and/J conscientious/N ./.
In/I this/D sense/N ,/, a/D teacher/N can/M be/V compared/V to/T one/C 's/P family/N doctor/N ./.
If/U he/P were/V brilliant/J ,/, he/P probably/V would/M not/R be/V a/D family/N doctor/N in/I the/D first/J place/N ./.
If/U he/P is/V competent/V and/I conscientious/N ,/, he/P serves/V us/R well/V ./.
Our/N teachers/N are/V not/V an/D important/J factor/N in/I our/P educational/J crisis/N ./.
Whether/N they/P are/V or/V are/R not/V underpaid/N is/I a/D problem/N of/I equity/N ;/: it/P is/V not/V an/D educational/J problem/N ./.
It/P is/V silly/J libel/N on/I our/P teachers/V to/T think/V they/P would/M educate/V our/P children/V better/R if/R only/V they/P got/V a/D few/J thousand/C dollars/C a/D year/N more/R ./.
It/P is/V the/D kind/N of/I libel/F the/D teachers/N '/P unions/N do/V n't/R mind/N spreading/N ,/, for/I their/P own/P narrow/J purposes/N ./.
It/P is/V also/I the/D kind/N of/I libel/N politicians/N find/V useful/J ,/, since/V it/P helps/V them/P strike/V a/D friendly/J posture/N on/I behalf/N of/I an/D important/J constituency/N ./.
But/U there/E is/V not/R one/C shred/N of/I evidence/E that/W ,/, other/J things/N being/V equal/J ,/, salary/N differentials/N result/V in/I educational/J differentials/N ./.
If/U there/E were/I such/J evidence/N ,/, you/U can/M be/V sure/U you/U would/M have/V heard/V of/I it/P ./.
If/U we/P wish/V to/T be/V serious/J about/I American/N education/N ,/, we/P know/V exactly/R what/W to/T do/E --/: and/C ,/, just/R as/V important/J ,/, what/W not/V to/T do/V ./.
There/E are/V many/I successful/J schools/N scattered/V throughout/I this/D nation/N ,/, some/R of/I them/P in/I the/D poorest/J of/I ghettos/N ,/, and/C they/P are/V all/R sending/V us/V the/D same/J message/N ./.
Conversely/N ,/, there/E are/V the/D majority/N of/I unsuccessful/J schools/N ,/, and/C we/P know/V which/D efforts/N at/I educational/J reform/N are/V doomed/J beforehand/N ./.
We/P really/V do/V know/V all/I we/P need/V to/T know/V ,/, if/R only/V we/P could/M assimilate/V this/D knowledge/N into/I our/P thinking/N ./.
In/I this/D respect/N ,/, it/P would/M be/V helpful/R if/V our/P political/J leaders/N were/I mute/N ,/, rather/R than/I eloquently/N ``/N concerned/V ./. ''/'
They/N are/V inevitably/R inclined/V to/T echo/V the/D conventional/J pap/N ,/, since/V this/D is/I the/D least/J controversial/J option/N that/I is/D open/J to/T them/P ./.
Thus/N at/I the/D recent/J governors/N '/P conference/N on/I education/N ,/, Gov./C Bill/N Clinton/N of/I Arkansas/N announced/V that/D ``/N this/D country/N needs/V a/D comprehensive/J child-development/N policy/N for/I children/N under/C five/C ./. ''/'
A/D comprehensive/J development/N policy/N for/I governors/N over/I 30/N would/M seem/V to/T be/V a/D more/J pressing/N need/N ./.
What/W Gov./C Clinton/N is/I advocating/N ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, is/V extending/V the/D educational/J system/N down/V to/T the/D pre-kindergarten/N years/N ./.
Whether/N desirable/V or/V not/R ,/, this/D is/I a/D child-care/N program/N ,/, not/V an/D educational/J program/N ./.
We/P know/V that/W very/V early/J exposure/N to/T schooling/V improves/J performance/N in/I the/D first/J grade/N ,/, but/R afterward/V the/D difference/N is/I quickly/P washed/V away/R ./.
Let/N us/N sum/N up/R what/W we/P do/V know/V about/I education/N and/C about/C those/J education/N reforms/N that/W do/V work/V and/R do/V n't/R work/V :/: --/: ``/C Parental/N involvement/N ''/' is/I a/D bad/J idea/N ./.
Parents/N are/V too/R likely/V to/T blame/V schools/V for/I the/D educational/J limitations/N of/I their/D children/N ./.
Parents/` should/M be/V involved/V with/I their/D children/N 's/P education/N at/I home/N ,/, not/V in/I school/N ./.
They/U should/M see/V to/T it/V that/D their/J kids/N do/V n't/R play/J truant/N ;/: they/P should/M make/V certain/J that/I the/D children/N spend/V enough/V time/R doing/V homework/N ;/: they/P should/M scrutinize/V the/D report/N card/N ./.
If/U parents/N are/V dissatisfied/J with/I a/D school/N ,/, they/P should/M have/V the/D option/N of/I switching/N to/T another/V ./.
--/: ``/C Community/N involvement/N ''/' is/I an/D even/R worse/J idea/N ./.
Here/N ,/, the/D experience/N of/I New/N York/N City/N is/I decisive/J ./.
Locally/N elected/N school/N boards/N ,/, especially/V in/I our/P larger/J cities/N ,/, become/V the/D prey/N of/I ambitious/N ,/, generally/D corrupt/J ,/, and/C invariably/C demagogic/C local/J politicians/N or/V would-be/N politicians/N ./.
New/N York/N is/V in/I the/D process/N of/I trying/P to/T disengage/V itself/P from/I a/D 20-year-old/N commitment/N to/T this/D system/N of/I school/N governance/N ,/, even/V as/I Chicago/N and/I other/J cities/N are/V moving/V to/T institute/N it/P ./.
--/: In/I most/J states/N ,/, increasing/J expenditures/N on/I education/N ,/, in/I our/P current/J circumstances/N ,/, will/M probably/R make/V things/R worse/J ,/, not/V better/R ./.
The/D reason/N is/I simple/J :/: Education/N takes/I place/N in/I the/D classroom/N ,/, where/I the/D influence/N of/I money/P is/V minimal/J ./.
Decades/N of/I educational/J research/N tell/V us/J unequivocally/N that/W even/V smaller/J classes/N have/V zero/C effect/N on/I the/D academic/J performance/N of/I the/D pupils/N --/: though/V they/P may/M sometimes/V be/R desirable/V for/I other/J reasons/N ./.
The/D new/J money/N flows/N into/I the/D already/J top-heavy/N administrative/N structure/N ,/, which/W busies/` itself/P piling/N more/R and/V more/R paper/I work/N on/I the/D teachers/N ./.
There/E is/D neither/J mystery/N nor/C paradox/N in/I the/D fact/N that/I as/D educational/J expenditures/N -LRB-/N in/I real/J terms/N -RRB-/N have/V increased/J sharply/N in/I the/D past/J quarter-of-a-century/N --/: we/P now/V spend/V more/R per/J pupil/N than/I any/D other/J country/N in/I the/D world/N --/: educational/J performance/N has/V declined/V ./.
That/N is/I the/D way/N the/D system/N works/N ./.
--/: Students/U should/M move/V up/R the/D educational/J ladder/N as/I their/D academic/J potential/N allows/V ./.
No/U student/F should/M be/V permitted/V to/T be/V graduated/N from/I elementary/J school/N without/I having/P mastered/V the/D 3/N R/N 's/P at/I the/D level/N that/I prevailed/J 20/N years/V ago/R ./.
This/N means/V ``/N tracking/N ,/, ''/' whose/D main/J purpose/N is/V less/R to/T permit/V the/D gifted/J youngsters/N to/T flourish/V -LRB-/N though/V that/W is/V clearly/R desirable/J -RRB-/N than/V to/T ensure/V that/I the/D less/J gifted/N get/V the/D necessary/J grounding/N for/I further/J study/N or/V for/I entering/V the/D modern/J world/N of/I work/N ./.

He/P will/M succeed/V Harry/N L./N Freeman/N ,/, 57/N ,/, who/W has/V said/V he/P will/M retire/V in/I December/N ./.

The/D company/N later/R apologized/V and/R agreed/V to/T make/V $/$ 8/C million/C in/I contributions/N to/T charities/V chosen/V by/I him/P ./.

Ad/N industry/N executives/N were/V n't/R surprised/V by/I Mr./N Roman/N 's/P decision/N to/T leave/V Ogilvy/N ./.
The/D agency/N ,/, under/I his/D direction/N ,/, bitterly/R fought/V a/D takeover/N attempt/N by/I WPP/N Group/N PLC/N of/I London/N before/I succumbing/N in/I May/N ./.

Mr./N Roman/N appears/V custom-made/N for/I the/D American/N Express/N job/N ./.
Known/N as/I a/D traditional/J executive/N ,/, he/P is/V very/V much/R in/I the/D conservative/J American/N Express/N mold/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, after/I 26/N years/N at/I Ogilvy/N he/P had/V honed/V a/D reputation/N for/I being/N squeaky-clean/N and/I a/D straight/J arrow/N --/: which/W can/M only/V help/J American/N Express/N in/I the/D wake/N of/I the/D Safra/N incident/N ./.

The/D abrupt/J management/N change/V sparked/V widespread/J speculation/N that/I Mr./N Roman/N had/V been/V pushed/V out/R of/I Ogilvy/N 's/P top/V spot/N by/I Mr./N Sorrell/N ./.
But/C Mr./N Roman/N flatly/N denied/V the/D speculation/N ,/, saying/V Mr./N Sorrell/N had/V tried/V several/J times/N to/T persuade/V him/P to/T stay/V ,/, offering/V various/J incentives/N and/C in/I one/C instance/N sending/V a/D note/N with/I a/D case/N of/I wine/N -LRB-/C The/D wine/N ,/, naturally/W ,/, was/D Seagram/N 's/P brand/N ,/, an/D Ogilvy/N client/N -RRB-/N ./.

Mr./N Roman/N said/V American/N Express/N 's/P Mr./N Robinson/N first/I approached/V him/P about/I the/D job/N in/I late/J September/N ./.

Mr./N Roman/N also/I brushed/N aside/I reports/N about/I infighting/N between/I him/P and/J Mr./N Phillips/N ,/, his/P successor/N at/I Ogilvy/N ./.
The/D two/J executives/N could/M hardly/R be/V more/R different/J ./.

Mr./N Roman/N 's/P departure/N is/V n't/R expected/V to/T have/V any/D enormous/J repercussions/N at/I Ogilvy/N ./.

Mr./N Joseph/N conceded/V the/D junk/N market/N was/V in/I disarray/N ,/, according/V to/T people/N familiar/V with/I the/D discussion/N ./.
He/P said/V Drexel/` --/: the/D leading/J underwriter/N of/I high-risk/N junk/I bonds/N --/: could/M no/V longer/R afford/V to/T sell/V any/D junk/N offerings/V if/V they/P might/M later/R become/V troubled/V because/V Drexel/N risked/N losing/V its/P highly/V lucrative/J junk/N franchise/N ./.

And/N investors/N and/C traders/N alike/V say/V the/D current/J turmoil/N could/M take/V years/N to/T resolve/V ./.
Amid/` the/D market/N disorder/N ,/, even/V Drexel/N ,/, which/W has/V the/D widest/J and/N most/I loyal/J following/I of/D junk/N bond/N investors/N ,/, is/D pulling/N in/I its/D horns/N ./.
Although/V the/D big/J investment/N bank/N still/R dominates/V the/D junk/N market/N ,/, Drexel/N has/V been/V unable/V to/T stem/V the/D fallout/N from/I growing/J junk/N bond/N defaults/N ,/, withdrawn/V new/I offerings/N ,/, redemptions/N by/I shareholders/N in/I junk/N bond/N mutual/N funds/N and/I an/D exodus/N of/I once-devoted/N investors/N ./.

This/N time/N ,/, the/D scandal/N centers/N on/I donations/N made/V by/I the/D not-quite-mainstream/N pachinko/N parlor/N industry/N ./.
Pachinko/N ,/, a/D kind/N of/I pinball/N ,/, is/D Japan/N 's/P favorite/N form/V of/I legal/J gambling/N ./.

But/U the/D implications/N could/M be/V great/I ./.
Pachinko/N is/V slightly/R on/I the/D shady/N side/N ,/, often/D linked/N to/T the/D lower/J ranks/N of/I Japan/N 's/P underworld/N and/C regularly/C at/I the/D top/N of/I annual/J lists/N of/I tax/N evaders/N ./.

Also/U ,/, about/C 60/N %/N of/I pachinko/N parlor/N owners/N are/V Korean/N ,/, many/R of/I whom/N maintain/V close/P ties/N with/I North/N or/V South/N Korean/N residents/N '/P organizations/N ,/, and/C donations/N by/I such/J foreign/J groups/N are/V illegal/V in/I Japan/N ./.
To/N many/I Japanese/N ,/, pachinko/N is/I benign/N or/V enticingly/N unsavory/N ./.
Garish/N neon/N pachinko/N marquees/N blaze/N from/I the/D main/J streets/N and/I narrow/J alleys/N of/I cities/N and/C towns/N across/I the/D country/N ./.
Devotees/N pass/V hours/N ,/, watching/V the/D lights/N blink/N and/C listening/N to/T the/D metal/N balls/N ping/N ,/, as/V much/R to/T gamble/V as/V to/T get/V a/D little/J time/N to/T be/V anonymous/N ,/, alone/V with/I their/D thoughts/N ./.
At/C 500/N yen/N -LRB-/C $/$ 3.60/C -RRB-/N for/I a/D handful/N of/I balls/N ,/, pachinko/N is/I a/D common/J pastime/N ,/, and/C has/V been/V since/V it/P took/V root/N as/I cheap/J entertainment/N in/I the/D years/N after/I World/N War/N II/N ./.

And/N because/V the/D pachinko/N industry/N is/V regularly/R at/I the/D top/N of/I annual/J lists/N for/I tax/N evasion/N ,/, some/I observers/N estimate/V the/D real/J income/N could/M be/V as/V much/R as/V 20/N trillion/N yen/N ./.
If/U that/W money/P were/V being/R taxed/V ,/, it/P could/M bring/V the/D government/N a/D badly/N needed/V several/J trillion/N yen/N ./.
In/I 1984/N ,/, an/D attempt/N was/V made/V to/T crack/V down/R on/I the/D industry/N with/I tougher/J restrictions/N ./.
Then/N ,/, in/I 1988/N ,/, a/D proposal/N to/T keep/V better/J track/N of/I income/N by/I selling/N prepaid/N cards/N for/I pachinko/N was/I fielded/N in/I parliament/N ./.

In/I August/N ,/, a/D conservative/J weekly/N magazine/N reported/V that/I a/D pachinko/N industry/N organization/N donated/V money/P to/T Japan/C Socialist/N Party/N members/N ./.

But/U the/D press/N kept/V it/P alive/V ;/: as/V with/I the/D Recruit/N scandal/N ,/, lists/N began/I circulating/N with/I names/N of/I people/N who/W had/V received/V money/N ./.
Within/U a/D matter/N of/I weeks/N ,/, less-conservative/C magazines/N reported/V that/D members/N of/I the/D ruling/N LDP/N had/V received/V much/R larger/J donations/N from/I pachinko/N organizations/N ./.
So/U far/R ,/, though/R ,/, there/E have/R been/V no/J allegations/N that/I the/D contributions/N the/D LDP/N members/N received/V amounted/V to/T bribes/N ./.
Then/N the/I two/C camps/N upped/C the/D ante/N :/: Reports/` that/D Chosen/N Soren/N had/V donated/V directly/W to/T JSP/C members/N were/V rapidly/R countered/V by/I statements/N that/I the/D South/N Korean/N residents/N '/P organization/N had/V long/R been/V donating/N directly/W to/T LDP/C members/N ./.
The/D JSP/N admitted/V Oct./N 13/N that/I its/D members/N received/V about/I eight/C million/C yen/N from/I the/D pachinko/N organization/N ,/, and/C charged/N LDP/N members/N with/I receiving/J 125/N million/C yen/N -LRB-/C $/$ 880,000/C -RRB-/N and/I other/J opposition/N parties/N with/I taking/V about/I 2.5/N million/C yen/N ./.

No/U one/C has/D alleged/N that/I the/D donations/N were/V by/I themselves/P illegal/V ./.
Direct/N donations/N from/I either/N of/I the/D residents/N '/P organizations/N would/M be/V illegal/V because/V the/D groups/N are/V defined/V as/I foreign/C ,/, but/V both/I groups/N deny/V making/V direct/J donations/N ./.
They/N say/V possible/V some/R of/I their/D members/N may/M be/V donating/N privately/N ./.
The/D issue/N is/V further/I complicated/J because/R although/V the/D organizations/N represent/V Korean/N residents/N ,/, those/J residents/N were/V largely/R born/V and/R raised/V in/I Japan/N and/V many/R speak/V only/J Japanese/N ./.
That/W they/P retain/V Korean/N citizenship/N and/C ties/N is/I a/D reflection/N of/I history/N --/: their/P parents/N were/V shipped/V in/I as/D laborers/N during/I the/D decades/N when/I Japan/N occupied/V Korea/N before/I World/N War/N II/N --/: and/I the/D discrimination/N that/W still/R faces/C Koreans/N in/I Japanese/N society/N ./.
Many/J Japanese/N think/V it/P only/V natural/J that/I the/D organizations/N or/V their/P members/N would/M donate/V to/T politicians/N ,/, the/D way/N many/I Japanese/N do/V ,/, to/T win/V favor/R or/V support/N ./.

But/C LDP/N members/N and/C supporters/N of/I the/D prepaid/N card/N idea/N tend/V to/T speak/V in/I innuendo/N about/I the/D JSP/N 's/P alleged/N donations/N ,/, implying/V that/D North/N Korean/N money/P would/M be/V more/R suspect/V than/I South/N Korean/N because/I North/N Korea/N is/I communist/N and/C South/N Korea/N is/I an/D ally/N ./.

However/U ,/, these/J figures/N do/V n't/R seem/V to/T worry/U Thomas/C A./N Durkin/N ,/, an/D economist/N at/I the/D Federal/N Reserve/N Board/N ./.
In/I a/D paper/N presented/V at/I the/D recent/J annual/N meeting/N of/I the/D National/N Association/N of/I Business/N Economists/N in/I San/N Francisco/N ,/, Mr./N Durkin/N comments/N that/I ``/N installment/N credit/N always/P grows/V rapidly/R in/I cyclical/N advances/N ,/, and/C growth/N in/I this/D cycle/N is/V very/R typical/V of/I earlier/J experiences/N ./.

But/U what/W about/I the/D debt/N burden/N ?/.
Mr./N Durkin/N doubts/N that/W ``/- there/E is/V some/I magic/J level/N ''/' at/I which/W the/D ratio/N of/I installment/N debt/N to/T disposable/V income/N ``/N indicates/I economic/N problems/N ./. ''/'
And/N ,/, ``/C more/J importantly/N ,/, ''/' he/P says/V ,/, ``/C the/D debt/N burden/N measured/V other/J ways/N is/V not/R really/V in/I uncharted/N waters/N ./. ''/'
The/D chart/N below/R shows/V why/R -LRB-/V see/V accompanying/J illustration/N --/: WSJ/C Oct./N 23/N ,/, 1989/C -RRB-/N ./.
The/D ratio/N of/I consumer/J installment/N credit/N to/T disposable/V income/N ,/, though/V up/R a/D bit/N ,/, has/V n't/R climbed/V steeply/N ,/, and/C such/J debt/N as/I a/D percent/N of/I household/N assets/N is/V little/R changed/V ./.
Moreover/N ,/, the/D burden/N of/I consumer/J credit/N payments/N relative/N to/T disposable/V income/N may/M be/V ``/N lower/I in/I this/D cycle/N than/I earlier/J ,/, ''/' Mr./N Durkin/N says/V ./.
He/P notes/N that/I some/J ``/N revolving/N credit-card/N credit/N is/V actually/V convenience/N credit/N ''/' being/R used/V simply/R as/V a/D handy/J way/N of/I paying/J bills/N rather/R than/I a/D handy/J way/N of/I borrowing/N ./.
In/I addition/N ,/, he/P says/V ,/, ``/C longer/J maturities/N on/I automobile/N and/I other/J forms/N of/I installment/N credit/N boost/V the/D stock/N of/I debt/N faster/R than/I the/D flow/N of/I repayments/N and/I the/D accompanying/J payment/N burden/N ./. ''/'
And/U if/R you/U ``/` consider/V the/D changing/J distribution/N of/I credit/N ,/, ''/' Mr./N Durkin/N says/V ,/, ``/C much/R of/I the/D increase/N in/I debt/N in/I recent/J years/N is/V due/V to/T increasing/J credit/N use/V by/I higher-income/N families/N ,/, ''/' that/W is/V ,/, ``/C those/R probably/V best/R able/V to/T handle/V it/P ./. ''/'
Citing/N figures/N on/I home-equity/N loans/N ,/, he/P notes/N that/I ``/N 11/N %/N of/I homeowners/N had/I home-equity/N credit/N accounts/N ,/, but/V the/D proportion/N rises/V to/T 16/C %/N of/I homeowners/N in/I the/D $/$ 45,000-$60,000/C income/N range/N and/C 23/N %/N of/I homeowners/N with/I income/N above/I $/$ 60,000/C ./.

So/N ,/, it/P is/V n't/R surprising/I that/D consumer-credit/N delinquencies/N at/I banks/N remain/V ,/, as/V the/D chart/N shows/V ,/, reassuringly/C below/N some/I earlier/J highs/N -LRB-/N see/V accompanying/J illustration/N --/: WSJ/C Oct./N 23/N ,/, 1989/C -RRB-/N ./.

In/I fact/N ,/, the/D current/J weakness/N in/I auto/N buying/C and/C department-store/N sales/N and/I the/D gradual/J upturn/N in/I the/D household/N saving/I rate/N suggest/V that/D consumers/N ,/, conservative/N as/V ever/R ,/, are/V already/R clutching/V their/P purses/V a/D bit/N more/R tightly/C ./.

China/` could/M exhaust/V its/D foreign-exchange/N reserves/N as/V early/I as/D next/J year/N ,/, a/D Western/N government/N report/N says/V ,/, unless/V imports/C are/V cut/V drastically/V to/T help/V narrow/R the/D balance-of-payments/N deficit/N ./.
According/N to/T the/D report/N ,/, completed/V last/J month/N ,/, if/V China/N 's/P trade/N gap/N continues/V to/T widen/V at/I the/D pace/N seen/V in/I the/D first/J seven/C months/N of/I this/D year/N ,/, the/D reserves/N would/M be/V wiped/V out/R either/V in/I 1990/N or/V 1991/N ./.

The/D $/$ 14/C billion/C of/I reserves/N China/N had/V in/I June/N would/M cover/V just/R that/W much/R ./.
The/D report/N by/I the/D Western/N government/N ,/, which/W declines/V to/T be/V identified/V ,/, concludes/N that/W ``/` a/D near-term/N foreign-exchange/N payment/N problem/V can/M be/V avoided/V only/R if/V import/N growth/N drops/V to/T below/J 5/N %/N per/C annum/N ./. ''/'
According/N to/T Chinese/N customs/N figures/N ,/, import/N growth/N has/V slowed/V in/I recent/J months/N ,/, dropping/V to/T 16/C %/N in/I July/N and/C 7.1/N %/N in/I August/N from/I the/D year-earlier/N periods/N ,/, compared/V with/I an/D average/J growth/N rate/N of/I 26/N %/N in/I the/D first/J half/N ./.
But/C before/I import/N growth/N slowed/V ,/, China/N 's/P buying/N spree/N in/I the/D first/J half/N already/V had/V taken/V its/D toll/N on/I foreign-exchange/N reserves/N ./.
The/D $/$ 14/C billion/C level/N in/I June/N marked/I a/D drop/N from/I $/$ 19/C billion/C at/I the/D end/N of/I April/N ./.
China/` 's/P last/V big/J import/N binge/N sent/V reserves/N tumbling/N to/T $/$ 10.6/C billion/C in/I June/N 1985/N from/I $/$ 16.6/C billion/C the/D previous/J September/N ./.
China/` might/M stave/V off/I a/D crisis/N if/V it/P acts/N as/I forcefully/N as/I it/P did/V to/T arrest/V the/D 1985/N decline/N ,/, when/W Beijing/N slammed/V the/D brakes/N on/I foreign-exchange/N spending/V and/R devalued/V the/D currency/N ./.
But/U this/D time/N ,/, China/C faces/C a/D more/J difficult/J battle/N because/V of/I economic/N forces/N that/W have/V come/V into/I play/N since/V the/D Tiananmen/N Square/N killings/N June/N 4/N ./.
For/N example/N ,/, China/N 's/P hard-currency/N income/N is/V expected/V to/T suffer/V from/I the/D big/J drop/N in/I tourist/P arrivals/N since/V June/N 4/N ./.

Because/N of/I this/D and/I the/D huge/J trade/N gap/N ,/, the/D deficit/N in/I China/N 's/P current/J account/N ,/, which/W measures/N trade/N in/I goods/N and/C services/N plus/I certain/J unilateral/N transfers/N of/I funds/N ,/, is/V expected/V to/T widen/V sharply/N from/I the/D $/$ 3.8/C billion/C deficit/N last/I year/N ./.
The/D Western/N government/N report/N suggests/V a/D number/N of/I scenarios/N for/I China/N 's/P current-account/N balance/N ,/, two/C of/I which/W are/V considered/V most/R likely/V ./.
In/I one/C ,/, imports/C and/C exports/N continue/V to/T grow/V at/I the/D respective/J average/N rates/N of/I 25/N %/N and/C 5/N %/N recorded/V during/I the/D first/J seven/C months/N ,/, and/I the/D current-account/N deficit/N widens/N to/T $/$ 13.1/C billion/C ./.
In/I 1985/N ,/, China/N had/I a/D record/N deficit/N of/I $/$ 11.4/C billion/C ./.
The/D other/J scenario/N assumes/V that/D Beijing/N takes/V effective/J actions/N to/T curb/V imports/C in/I the/D coming/J months/N ./.
In/I this/D case/N ,/, China/` would/M still/R finish/V the/D year/N with/I a/D current-account/N deficit/N of/I $/$ 8.7/C billion/C ,/, based/V on/I projections/N that/I imports/C for/I all/C of/I this/D year/N grow/V 20/N %/N and/C exports/C 10/N %/N ./.
If/U China/` were/V still/R on/I good/J terms/N with/I foreign/J lenders/N ,/, it/P might/M be/V able/V to/T stem/V the/D drain/N on/I its/D foreign-exchange/N reserves/N by/I using/V some/I loan/N funds/N to/T offset/V the/D current-account/N deficit/N ./.
But/R since/V June/N ,/, foreign/C bankers/N led/V by/I international/D financial/J institutions/N have/V virtually/R suspended/V their/D new/J loans/N to/T China/N ./.
Even/N if/V borrowing/N resumes/N ,/, commercial/J bankers/N are/V n't/R expected/V to/T lend/V as/V much/R as/V before/R ./.
In/I addition/N ,/, economists/N are/V forecasting/N a/D slowdown/N in/I foreign/C direct/J investments/N as/I businessmen/N become/V increasingly/R wary/V of/I China/N 's/P deteriorating/V political/J and/J economic/N environment/N ./.
On/N top/V of/I all/C this/D ,/, foreign-debt/C repayments/N are/V expected/V to/T peak/V in/I 1991/N to/T 1992/N ./.
With/N less/I capital/N coming/V in/I ,/, China/N 's/P balance/N of/I payments/N would/M suffer/V ./.
The/D Western/N government/N report/N 's/P first/D scenario/N assumes/V a/D 30/N %/N reduction/N in/I foreign/J borrowing/N and/I a/D 5/N %/N contraction/N in/I foreign/C direct/J investment/N ./.
In/I the/D second/N ,/, foreign/C borrowing/N is/I projected/N to/T grow/V 10/N %/N and/C investment/N to/T drop/V 10/N %/N ./.
But/C in/I either/J case/N ,/, the/D report/N says/V ,/, China/N 's/P balance/N of/I payments/N would/M rapidly/R dry/V up/R foreign/J reserves/N ,/, which/W are/V used/V to/T finance/V the/D imbalance/N ./.

The/D White/N Plains/N ,/, N.Y./N ,/, oil/N company/N said/V Friday/U that/W it/P had/V acquired/V Tana/N Production/N Corp./N ,/, a/D subsidiary/N of/I TRT/N Energy/N Holdings/N Inc./N ,/, for/I $/$ 95.1/C million/C in/I cash/N ,/, with/I the/D rest/N to/T be/V paid/V in/I shares/N of/I a/D new/J ,/, non-voting/C issue/N of/I preferred/J stock/N ./.
Tana/N ,/, which/W holds/V properties/N in/I 17/N oil/N and/C gas/N fields/N in/I south/N Texas/N ,/, will/M provide/V Texaco/N with/I mostly/C gas/N reserves/N ./.
The/D fields/N contain/V recoverable/N reserves/N of/I 435/N billion/C cubic/C feet/N of/I natural/J gas/N and/C four/C million/C barrels/N of/I oil/N ./.
``/N This/N acquisition/N is/I another/D indication/N of/I Texaco/N 's/P commitment/N to/T increase/V the/D company/N 's/P reserve/N base/N ,/, ''/' said/V Chief/N Executive/N Officer/N James/N W./N Kinnear/N ./.
Texaco/N has/V also/R been/V attempting/V to/T sell/V oil/N properties/N ./.
At/C least/N two/C years/N ago/R ,/, the/D company/N put/V 60/C million/C barrels/N of/I oil/N reserves/N on/I the/D block/N ./.
They/N were/V either/V too/R small/J or/N uneconomic/N to/T maintain/V ,/, the/D company/N said/V ./.
Not/N all/I of/D those/J parcels/N have/V yet/R been/V sold/V ./.
Texaco/N acquired/V Tana/N before/I it/P completed/V those/R sales/V because/V Tana/N 's/P properties/N are/V high/J quality/N and/C near/I other/J fields/N Texaco/N already/V owns/V ,/, a/D company/N spokeswoman/N said/V ./.
Texaco/N ,/, like/V many/I other/J oil/N companies/N ,/, has/V been/V struggling/V to/T replace/V its/D falling/N oil/N and/C gas/N reserves/N ./.
Texaco/` 's/P situation/N had/V become/V particularly/I complex/N because/V much/R of/I its/D effort/N had/V for/I years/N been/V focused/V on/I its/D brawl/N with/I Pennzoil/N and/C then/N on/I New/N York/N investor/N Carl/N C./N Icahn/N 's/P attempt/N to/T take/V over/I the/D company/N ./.
Pennzoil/N had/V sued/V Texaco/N for/I improperly/J interfering/N with/I its/D acquisition/N of/I a/D portion/N of/I Getty/N Oil/N Co/N ./.
Eventually/N ,/, Texaco/N ,/, which/W was/V forced/V into/I bankruptcy/N proceedings/N by/I that/D litigation/N ,/, settled/V its/D fight/N with/I Pennzoil/N for/I $/$ 3/C billion/C in/I 1986/N ./.
Mr./N Icahn/N ,/, who/W played/V a/D key/J role/N in/I the/D settlement/N and/C attempted/M subsequently/V to/T take/V control/N of/I the/D company/N ,/, sold/V his/P stake/N in/I Texaco/N just/V last/J summer/N ./.
Completion/N of/I Texaco/N 's/P acquisition/N of/I Tana/N is/I subject/N to/T government/N approval/N under/I the/D Hart-Scott-Rodino/N Antitrust/N Improvements/N Act/N ./.
CRI/N Inc./N said/V it/P reduced/V the/D estimated/N cash/N distribution/N for/I its/D Capital/N Housing/N and/C Mortgage/N Partners/N Inc./N trust/N to/T between/C 71/N cents/N and/C 74/N cents/V a/D share/N ,/, from/I between/D 75/N cents/N and/C 80/N cents/N ,/, for/I the/D year/N ending/N June/N 9/N ,/, 1990/N ./.
The/D change/N in/I expected/J cash/N distributions/N from/I the/D Champs/N real/I estate/N investment/N trust/N stems/V from/I a/D revised/J estimate/N of/I administrative/J costs/N ,/, said/V Jay/N R./N Cohen/N ,/, Champs/C executive/N vice/J president/N ./.
CRI/N ,/, which/W sponsors/V Champs/N ,/, is/I a/D world-wide/N real/I estate/N investment/N firm/N ./.
H&R/N BLOCK/N Inc./N had/I net/N income/N of/I $/$ 100.2/C million/C ,/, or/V $/$ 1.90/C a/D share/N ,/, in/I the/D fiscal/N year/N ended/V April/N 30/N ./.

Groupe/N AG/N 's/P chairman/N said/V the/D Belgian/N insurer/N is/V prepared/V to/T give/V up/R some/V of/I its/D independence/N to/T a/D white/J knight/N if/V necessary/V to/T repel/V a/D raider/N ./.
Amid/` heavy/J buying/N of/I shares/N in/I Belgium/N 's/P largest/J insurer/N ,/, Maurice/C Lippens/N also/V warned/V in/I an/D interview/N that/I a/D white/J knight/N ,/, in/I buying/N out/I a/D raider/N ,/, could/M leave/V speculators/N with/I big/J losses/N on/I their/D AG/N stock/N ./.
Since/I the/D beginning/N of/I the/D year/N ,/, the/D stock/N has/V nearly/I doubled/N ,/, giving/I AG/C a/D market/N value/N of/I about/C 105/C billion/C Belgian/N francs/N -LRB-/C $/$ 2.7/C billion/C -RRB-/N ./.
The/D most/J likely/I white/D knight/N would/M be/V Societe/` Generale/- de/F Belgique/C S.A./N ,/, which/W already/V owns/V 18/N %/N of/I AG/N and/C which/W itself/P is/V controlled/V by/I Cie/N ./. Financiere/- de/F Suez/- ,/, the/D acquisitive/N French/N financial/N conglomerate/N ./.
But/C Mr./N Lippens/N said/V a/D rescue/N also/I could/M involve/V Asahi/N Mutual/N Life/N Insurance/N Co./N ,/, which/W owns/V 5/N %/N of/I AG/N ./.
AG/N is/V hardly/R alone/V in/I its/D anxiety/N ./.
A/D rambunctious/N shake-up/N is/I quickly/P reshaping/N Europe/N 's/P once-stately/N insurance/N business/N ./.
Worried/N by/I European/N Community/N directives/N that/W will/M remove/V many/R of/I the/D barriers/N to/T cross-border/C insurance/N services/N ,/, starting/V in/I mid-1990/N ,/, insurers/N are/V rushing/R to/T find/V partners/C and/C preparing/N for/I price/N wars/N ./.
In/I West/N Germany/N and/I the/D Netherlands/N ,/, insurers/N are/V flirting/N with/I banks/N ./.
In/I France/N ,/, Suez/C and/C Axa-Midi/N Assurances/N S.A./N both/V have/R been/V on/I the/D prowl/N for/I giant/J acquisitions/N ;/: Suez/` last/J month/N acquired/V control/N of/I Groupe/N Victoire/N ,/, the/D sixth-largest/N European/N insurance/N company/N ,/, after/I a/D takeover/N battle/N with/I Cie/N ./.

Mr./N Lippens/N said/V the/D volume/N of/I shares/C changing/J hands/N has/V grown/V significantly/R since/V mid-September/N ./.
But/U he/P estimated/N that/I a/D raider/N would/M have/V been/V able/V to/T amass/V no/V more/R than/I 4/N %/N of/I the/D shares/N in/I recent/J months/N ./.
Aside/N from/I exploring/J plans/N for/I joint/N ventures/N or/V acquisitions/N ,/, Mr./N Lippens/N has/V called/V top/J managers/N of/I companies/N rumored/V as/I potential/N raiders/N --/: among/I them/P ,/, Axa-Midi/N ,/, Union/S des/F Assurances/- de/F Paris/C and/C Suez/N ,/, all/R based/V in/I France/N ./.
They/N have/V all/J ``/N very/V clearly/R stated/V that/I they/P have/V not/R acquired/V and/R are/V not/R acquiring/V shares/N of/I AG/N ,/, ''/' he/P said/V ./.
Any/N raider/N would/M find/V it/P hard/J to/T crack/V AG/N 's/P battlements/N ./.
A/D ``/N syndicate/N ''/' of/I shareholders/N holds/V just/R under/J 50/N %/N of/I AG/N ,/, Mr./N Lippens/N said/V ,/, and/C members/N have/V agreed/V to/T give/V one/C another/I the/D right/N of/I first/D refusal/N should/I they/P sell/V any/D AG/N shares/N ./.

A/D Generale/N spokesman/N confirmed/V that/I the/D giant/J Belgian/N holding/V company/N would/M be/V willing/V to/T raise/V its/D stake/N in/I AG/N should/I a/D raider/N seek/V control/N ./.

Even/N without/I bid/N talk/N ,/, this/D year/N 's/P surge/N in/I prices/N for/I Brussels/N real/I estate/N has/V excited/J interest/N in/I AG/N ./.
The/D company/N says/V those/J holdings/N constitute/V the/D third-biggest/N real-estate/N portfolio/N in/I Belgium/N ./.
With/I the/D dust/N settling/N from/I the/D failed/J coup/N attempt/N in/I Panama/N ,/, one/C of/I the/D many/J lingering/N questions/V the/D Bush/N administration/N will/M ponder/V is/I this/D :/: Is/C the/D National/N Security/N Council/N staff/N big/J enough/N ,/, and/C does/M it/P have/V enough/V clout/N ,/, to/T do/V its/D job/N of/I coordinating/N foreign/C policy/N ?/.
President/N Bush/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N ,/, Lt./C Gen./N Brent/N Scowcroft/N ,/, came/V into/I office/N in/I January/N intent/N on/I making/V the/D NSC/N staff/N leaner/N and/I more/J disciplined/N than/I it/P had/V been/V during/I the/D Reagan/N administration/N ./.
Gen./N Scowcroft/N was/I a/D member/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/, which/W investigated/V the/D Iran-Contra/N affair/N ./.
He/P was/V all/R too/R aware/V of/I how/W a/D large/J ,/, inadequately/N supervised/N NSC/N staff/N had/V spun/V out/R of/I control/N and/C nearly/C wrecked/N President/N Reagan/N 's/P second/J term/N ./.
So/N ,/, following/I both/I the/D style/N he/P pursued/V as/I President/N Ford/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N and/I the/D recommendations/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/, Gen./C Scowcroft/N has/V pruned/V the/D NSC/N staff/N and/C tried/V to/T ensure/V that/I it/P sticks/N to/T its/D assigned/J tasks/N --/: namely/V ,/, gathering/I the/D views/N of/I the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/C and/C intelligence/N community/N ;/: serving/J as/I an/D honest/J broker/N in/I distilling/N that/I information/N for/I the/D president/N and/C then/N making/V sure/R presidential/J decisions/N are/V carried/V out/R ./.
The/D Tower/N Commission/N specifically/R said/V that/I the/D NSC/N staff/N should/M be/V ``/N small/P ''/' and/C warned/V against/I letting/J ``/N energetic/N self-starters/N ''/' like/R Lt./J Col./N Oliver/N North/N strike/N out/R on/I their/P own/P rather/R than/V leaving/V the/D day-to-day/N execution/N of/I policies/N to/T the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/N or/V Central/N Intelligence/N Agency/N ./.
However/U ,/, the/D Panama/N episode/N has/V raised/V questions/N about/I whether/V the/D NSC/N staff/N is/V sufficiently/V big/J ,/, diverse/J and/I powerful/J to/T coordinate/N U.S./N policy/N on/I tough/J issues/N ./.
During/I the/D coup/N attempt/N and/I its/D aftermath/N ,/, NSC/C staffers/N were/I ``/N stretched/V very/R thin/V ,/, ''/' says/V one/C senior/J administration/N official/N ./.
``/` It/P 's/V a/D very/R small/J shop/N ./. ''/'

The/D NSC/N staff/N ``/N does/M n't/R have/V the/D horsepower/N that/I I/P believe/V is/V required/V to/T have/V an/D effective/J interagency/N process/N ,/, ''/' says/V Frank/N Gaffney/N ,/, a/D former/J Pentagon/N aide/N who/W now/R runs/V the/D Center/N for/I Security/N Policy/N ,/, a/D conservative/J Washington/N think-tank/N ./.
The/D problem/N with/I this/D administration/N ,/, I/P think/V ,/, is/I that/D by/J design/N it/P has/V greatly/R diminished/J ,/, both/C in/I a/D physical/J sense/N and/C in/I a/D procedural/J sense/N ,/, the/D role/N of/I the/D NSC/N ./. ''/'
The/D National/N Security/N Council/N itself/P was/V established/V in/I 1947/N because/I policy/N makers/N sensed/V a/D need/N ,/, in/I an/D increasingly/J complex/J world/N ,/, for/I a/D formal/J system/N within/I the/D White/N House/N to/T make/V sure/V that/D communications/N flowed/V smoothly/R between/I the/D president/N and/I the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/C and/C intelligence/N agencies/N ./.
By/N law/N ,/, the/D council/N includes/I the/D president/N ,/, vice/J president/N and/C secretaries/N of/I state/N and/C defense/N ./.
In/I practice/N ,/, the/D director/N of/I central/J intelligence/N and/C chairman/N of/I the/D Joint/N Chiefs/N of/I Staff/N also/V serve/V as/D unofficial/J members/N ./.
But/U the/D size/N ,/, shape/' and/C role/N of/I the/D NSC/N staff/N have/V been/V left/V for/I each/D president/N and/I his/D national/J security/N adviser/N to/T decide/V ./.
